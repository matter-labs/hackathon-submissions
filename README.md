| [Session Wallet](https://github.com/matter-labs/ETHLisbon-2022-hackathon/tree/main/submissions/session-wallet) | I created a wallet that can issue session keys. You give the issued session key to a trusted institution (e.g., a gaming company) to send transactions on your behalf. In other words, your wallet is temporarily under the control of that institution. However, you do not need to give them your private key, you just need to give them your session key. Of course, you can deactivate the session key. | ETH Lisbon 2022 ü•á | account abstraction |  |
